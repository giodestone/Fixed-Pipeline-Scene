1. Mention that the reason some of the values are layed out in such a way (e.g. drawing the sphere) is to make the code readable.
2. Reason that unqiue_ptr was used instead of shared pointer was because at the time there were plans of structring the code differently - 'unloading' objects etc.

3. The Load method exists as a way of loading stuff to the game that requires loading during runtime.

4. Lights are handled in the gameentitymanager as they make the day night cycle easier.
 
5. The wireframe is static because of the transparent town square thingy needing it.

6. Light parameters are set every frame because they didn't work otherwise for some reason.

1. Could've added a component system for mesh etc. (a lot how unity does it).
2. Could've added a helper draw function that simply took the static draw thingy and drew it depending on the variables passed in.
3. Probably a drawable base class coudld've fixed the above
